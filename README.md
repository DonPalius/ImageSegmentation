# ImageSegmentation

In the context of transportation, pilots need to identify possible urgent landing areas in forests.
Therefore, scientists have provided us with aerial photos of the forest and accompanying image
masks that indicate the presence of birch trees in the images. These masks are binary, with a value of
0 representing areas without birch trees and a value of 1 indicating the presence of birch trees. Our
objective is to utilize this dataset to train a model capable of performing semantic segmentation,
accurately identifying and delineating birch trees in the images.
